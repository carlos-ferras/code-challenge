### The Answer

source directory: `./compare_versions`

- Run `pip3 install cf_compare_versions`

usage: 
```
from compare_versions.compare_versions import compare_versions

result = compare_versions('1.0.0.2.9', '1.0.0.3.4')

# It will return:
#     A positive number: If the first version is greater than the second  
#     A negative number: If the first version is smaller than the second
#     Zero: If the versions are equals
```
